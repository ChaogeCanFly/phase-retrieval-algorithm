# Determining high-accuracy random phase-only masks for complex local modulation of light fields



In this work is presented an iterative algorithm that locally resolves the beam shaping problem by determining high-accuracy random phase-only masks. The algorithm is based on the spatial frequencies discrimination of the target field and the setting of numerical
constraints obtained by a simple theoretical development with actual optical meaning. The algorithm obtains different random phase-only masks with variable
accuracies stated by the user modifying an only optical parameter and for a wide variety of the input complex fields including those with random amplitude and
phase values. Due to the high-accuracy concerned in the calculated random phase-only masks for incident random complex light fields, the implementation of a double images encryption method with the simple optical setup is direct. Â© 2019 Optical Society of America
